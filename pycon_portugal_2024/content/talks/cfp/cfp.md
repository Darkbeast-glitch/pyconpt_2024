You may think that your idea is not suited to PyCon Portugal, or that you couldn't possibly present it well, or that others will do it better. We want to prove you wrong. Read more on [Why You, Too, Should Speak at a Conference](https://blog.usebutton.com/why-you-too-should-speak-at-a-conference){:target="_blank"}, which applies to speaking at PyCon Portugal!

If you would like to ask a question, you are always welcome to write to the content committee: [content@pycon.pt](mailto:content@pycon.pt).

## Bonuses

As a speaker, you will not need to buy a ticket, since you gain free entrance to the conference. If you have bought a ticket in advance before being accepted, we will refund it, of course. If you are not selected as a speaker, don't worry because you are still eligible for an early bird ticket.

For companies or employers: talks' content should not be influenced directly by commercial interests, but if your company or employer has supported your process for creating and giving the talk (for instance allowing you to prepare it in working hours), you are always welcome to mention this support during a talk.

## Guidelines

* Submit your talk in time, no excuses.

* All talks will be in English.

* Read, understand, and agree to our Code of Conduct. As a speaker, your talk and your slides will need to follow our Code of Conduct ‚Äì if you are not sure what that means, or have some issue you are not sure about, just ask us!

* Make sure you spend some time and effort on your proposal. Typos, lack of formatting, and half finished sentences are unnecessary and make your proposal hard to be taken seriously. (Ask a mentor or a friend to help if this is difficult for you.)

* Don't overdo it ‚Äì two or three paragraphs are plenty of space to give us an idea of your talk, we don't require an entire thesis. ;)

* Original content: Since we have little space and lots of submissions, we prefer original content. If your talk is so awesome that you want to give it in multiple places, we'd ask you to consider putting a new spin on it, if at all possible.

## Selection ProcessÔ∏è

Reviewing the talks and tutorials submitted to a conference can be a daunting task ‚Äì there is much to consider, and usually there are more great submissions than there are slots available in the conference schedule.

We‚Äôd like to make our reviewing process and guidelines transparent to every submitter and attendee, both to show you what will await you during the conference as an attendee, and to help you understand our decisions regarding your submissions as a submitter.

Moreover, we might prioritize speakers from an under-represented or marginalised group in order to increase the social impact of the conference.

We will document our selection process on this website and announce it via Twitter.

## Lightning TalksÔ∏è

Not up for a full talk or tutorial? Looking to give your first talk at a conference? Lightning talks are talks of 5 minutes or less, with or without slides, on almost any topic you want! Even if you‚Äôre nervous or shy, remember: it‚Äôs a MAXIMUM of 5 minutes. The conference will feature a lightning talk slot at the end of the day. Sign-ups will happen during the conference.
